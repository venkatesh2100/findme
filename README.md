##  Note About Database

Due to the **limited time constraint (2 days)** for this project, external databases were not integrated. However, if you're interested in evaluating my database and backend skills:

ðŸ‘‰ Check out [Planteras Store](https://planterastore.vercel.app/categories), an e-commerce app I built using **PostgreSQL** with full relational DB management.
